    <h3>Introduction To JavaScript - History</h3>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a programming language which was designed and built to enable programmers to implement complex features on web pages. It was designed and built by a language engineer called Brendan Eich.
        <br>

        Brendan Eich built JavaScript in 10 days and at the time he was hired by a company known as Netscape. He built it in 1995. The prototype that he came up with was crude and raw but it worked and had the fundamentals of a programming language.
        <br>

        Through the contributions of another programmer called Guy Steele, the language was standardized and the crudeness was removed. When Brendan Eich built it, he called it MOCHA. Then he changed the name to LIVESCRIPT and finally he renamed it JavaScript.
        <br>

        Note that JavaScript is different from Java. They are two completely different languages owned by different organisations.
        <br><br>

        <h3>JavaScript and ECMA</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript is built around the ECMA standard. It was initially designed to give dynamism and interactivity to the client side of static HTML pages. It was also initially designed for Netscape 2. In 1997 however, JavaScript adopted the standard of European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA).
            <br>

            A language library or standard was built around ECMA features and that standard was called ES (ECMA - Standard). Once this was done, Netscape handed over JavaScript to ECMA to manage but retained the right to develop the version that a firefox browser will be needing.
            <br>

            The first ES version was developed in 1997 and it known as ES1. In 1998 ES2 was developed and in 2000, ES3 was developed. Currently, we are in ES10/12, but the most stable version is ES6, though some companies still use ES5.
            <br>

            Today, several libraries have been built around JavaScript and its ES standards. These includes <br>
            <ul>
                <li>ReactJS (used for frontend development and for making API calls)</li>
                <li>NextJS (a framework built around ReactJS and used to integrate the frontend with the backend)</li>
                <li>ReactNative (used for mobile applications development)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>

            <p>
                All major browsers and search engines today run a JavaScript engine which itself is built around ES standards. These major search engines include:
            </p>
            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>Internet explorer / microsoft edge</li>
                <li>Mozilla firefox</li>
                <li>Google Chrome</li>
                <li>Google</li>
                <li>Yahoo</li>
                <li>Adobe</li>
                <li>Safari</li>
                <li>Opera</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>
        </p>

        <h3>JavaScript is an Event - Driven Languge</h3>

        <p>
            An Event - Driven Language is one whose instruction sense are governed by events 
            <ul>
                <li>the action of a keyboard</li>
                <li>the action of a mouse</li>
            </ul>
            
           <p>
            These two devices (a mouse and a keyboard) and the events they create constitute the triggers that drive functions in JavaScript. A mouse event can be
           </p>

            <ul>
                <li>a click</li>
                <li>double click</li>
                <li>a hover</li>
                <li>a pointer etc.</li>
            </ul>
            

            <p>
                A keyboard event can be any action taken with the keyboard. For example
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>enter button</li>
                <li>shift key</li>
                <li>backspace etc.</li>
            </ul>
             
        </p>

        <h3>Application of JavaScript</h3>

        <p>
            Though JavaScript was initially created to give dynamism to the frontend static pages of the web. It can today work with a browser and without a browser. When it works with a browser, it integrates with HTML and CSS and does the following
            <ul>
                <li>It creates real time content updates</li>
                <li>It makes API calls</li>
                <li>It links frontend to backend</li>
                <li>It gives dynamism and interactivity to web pages</li>
                <li>It performs routing</li>
                <li>It handles 2D and 3D animations and graphics</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <p>
                Along with HTML and CSS therefore, JavaScript constitutes the third leg in the basket of technologies that power the web globally. Outside the web, JavaScript can be used to create applications in the areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It provides a server side runtime environment for executing its codes outside the browser and it does this using Nodejs.
            <br><br>

            Outside of HTML and CSS, JavaScript can be used to develop several other application types. Examples include

            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Server - side applications using NodeJS</li>
                <li>Desktop applications using a framework called Electron</li>
                <li>Mobile applications development using ReactNative framework and NativeScript.</li>
                <li>Game development using any of the following frameworks - Web-GL, Phaser and/or ThreeJS </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>The language In Which JavaScript is Written</h3>

        <p>
            JavaScript was originally written in C language, but its modern implementation is in C++ language.JavaScript is a full programming language and so it complements HTML which is a markup language and CSS which is used for styling.
            <br>
            HTML and CSS are not programming languages. As a markup language for example, most of HTML's syntax and contents sit in between tags and HTML uses hyperlinks to connect one page to another. HTML is browser based and it is used to create static content and structure on a web page. 
            <br>
            On the otherhand, CSS is a stylesheet that uses a cascading method to execute instructions. It is also browser based and has to reference HTML tags and elements to effectively style its content. Like HTML, CSS builds statics pages. 
            <br>
            JavaScript is however different from HTML and CSS. It is a full programming language. It is built around the following features:
            <ul>
                <li>Data Type</li>
                <li>Data Structure</li>
                <li>Algorithms</li>
                <li>Variables</li>
                <li>Functions</li>
                <li>Objects</li>
                <li>Methods</li>
                <li>Arrays</li>
                <li>Conditional Statements</li>
                <li>Loops</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <p>Let us look at some of these terms and their meanings;</p>
            <br>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Data Type - Data type refers to the category that every piece of data received is structured into. Data can be numbers for example, it can be whole numbers (integers) or it can be numbers with decimals or floating points (floats). 
                    <br>
                    That can also be a STRING (a collection of characters - lowercase alphabets, uppercase alphabets and symbols like ?, !, etc).
                    <br>

                    Data can also be BOOLEAN (either / or, True / False, Yes / No).
                </li>

                <li>
                    Data Structure - Once data have been categorized into a data type, it has to be organized into a data structure to make it programmable. There are different types of data structures;
                    <ul type="disc">
                        <li>Arrays</li>
                        <li>list</li>
                        <li>Linked List</li>
                        <li>Graph</li>
                        <li>Stack</li>
                        <li>Queue</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Algorithms - These refers to the sequence of steps that a piece of code follows as it executes. There are different standard algorithms;
                    <ul type="disc">
                        <li>Sorting</li>
                        <li>Search</li>
                        <li>Divide and Conquer etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
